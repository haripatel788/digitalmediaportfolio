      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">ðŸ§  What was your experience with Adobe before taking this class?</h3>
      <p>Before high school, I had only a little experience with Premiere Pro, just enough to be familiar with the basics but not enough to feel confident using it. I had played around with the softwares but never explored its full potential. Taking this class changed that, giving me the structure and guidance to truly develop my skills. Now, Iâ€™m refining my approach, experimenting with transitions, effects, and editing techniques in a way that feels purposeful rather than just exploratory.</p>

    <div class="mt-6">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">ðŸŽ¨ What was your favorite project and why?</h3>
      <p>My favorite project that I created was the Vogue Photoshop assignment because it allowed me to fully embrace the creative process. Unlike more structured tasks, this project gave me the freedom to experiment with design, composition, and artistic creativity in a way that felt fun and engaging. I enjoyed the challenge of making the visuals polished and striking, while also playing with different elements to create something uniquely my own. The creativity behind it made the project feel less like an assignment and more like an opportunity to bring my vision to life.</p>

    <div class="mt-6">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">ðŸ“š What was the most important thing you learned?</h3>
      <p>The most important thing I learned was the importance of planning and organization in the creative process. Before this class, I often jumped into projects without a clear vision or plan, which led to confusion and frustration. Now, I understand that taking the time to outline my ideas, gather resources, and create a roadmap for my projects not only saves time but also enhances the quality of my work. This lesson has transformed how I approach all my creative endeavors, making me more efficient and focused.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">ðŸ’¼ How will you use these skills in the future?</h3>
      <p>If you are starting a business in your selected field, you might have to advertise your company or something; therefore, using Adobe can be handy. The skills Iâ€™ve gained in this class, such as creating visually appealing graphics, editing professional-quality videos, and designing engaging content, will be invaluable in promoting a brand or product. Whether itâ€™s crafting eye-catching social media posts, designing a sleek website, or producing compelling advertisements, these tools and techniques will allow me to stand out in a competitive market. Additionally, the ability to communicate ideas effectively through visual media is a skill that transcends industries, making it a powerful asset in any career path I choose to pursue.</p>
